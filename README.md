# Minecraft-Log-Viewer
### View your Minecraft Logs easier, to make solving issues faster!

So you get a "Error Code 1" in your Minecraft Modpack that you made. 

And you know that when you [look at the logs](https://new.reddit.com/r/CurseForge/comments/1bl7obj/modpack_making_minecraft_exit_code_1_solved_how/) (link to show you how to solve error code 1), you see all this text:

 or

But you want to be able to (mostly) easily be able to find out what is causing what issue. And you want to solve it without haveing to zoom in REEAAAL close to be able to read litterally anything.

With the Minecraft Log Viewer (XML File), your Minecraft Modpack logs file will look like this instead (inside of Notepad++ only):
